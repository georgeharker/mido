# The Mido Logo

The logo for Mido is two DIN (MIDI) connectors in the colors and position of
the snakes in the Python logo.

It was based on a trace of a DIN connector diagram and needs a bit of cleanup.

I've included a PNG render that we can use for now as a GitHub icon.

Revamped design borrowing the 
[Wikimedia Commons DIN-5 Diagram](
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DIN-5_Diagram.svg)
as a template and the
[Python logo's](https://www.python.org/community/logos/)
color gradiant and shadow.

Arranged the shapes to mimic the Python's snakes and give it more flair.

Named all the layers including numbering the pins according to the
[MIDI 5 Pin DIN Electrical Specs (aka CA-033)](
https://www.midi.org/specifications/midi-transports-specifications/5-pin-din-electrical-specs) 
connector:
[DIN 41524 / IEC/DIN EN 60130-9 types IEC-03 and IEC-04: five-pin, 45°, 180°](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector#Circular_connectors)

The SVG file includes 2 templates that can be used to
export the provided PNG renders
using Inkscape's bulk export:
- vertical portrait with shadow, 160×226 pixels (default)
- square, round compatible, no shadow, 192×192 pixels
